This sofware uses the PCRE library by Philip Hazel.

This sofware can be compiled to optionally contain an embedded version of
TinyXML.  Please see @subpage tinyxml_lic for additional licensing

This software uses the Freetype2 library to provide most of the font loading and
rendering support.  Freetype2 is a free, high-quality, and portable font engine;
see http://www.freetype.org for more information.

This software can be compiled to optionally contain embedded copies of Lua and
tolua++.  Please see the files luaCOPYRIGHT and tolua++README in the directory
./ScriptingModules/CEGUILua/lua_and_tolua++/ for additional licensing that may
apply to the use of these libraries.

This is Crazy Eddie's GUI System Mk-2; a free library providing windowing and
widgets for graphics APIs and engines where such functionality is not natively
available or is severely lacking. The library is written in C++, is object
orientated, and is primarily targeted at games developers who should be spending
their time creating great games, not building GUI sub-systems...

Note: In various documentation and online, the system is additionally referred
to as both CEGUI (which is the main namespace name), and cegui_mk2 (which was the
CVS module name of the Mk2 version of the system, and is now the root svn
directory for this part of the system).


The current version of CEGUI is licensed under the @subpage mit_license.

@section main_sec_1 Supported Systems
Crazy Eddie's GUI System Mk-2 is currently known to compile and run on the following systems:

- Various flavors of Linux using gcc.
- Microsoft Windows running VC++7.0 up and until VC++9, both 'express' and 'professional' versions.
- Apple Mac OS X running Xcode. (out of sync - we need a maintainer)

It is very possible that the system will compile and run on other systems and compilers, though the above systems have been tested.

NOTE: a long while ago VC6 support has been dropped.


@section main_sec_2 Requirements
As well as one of the above supported systems, Crazy Eddie's GUI System Mk-2 also requires the use of some third party external libraries.  These libraries are as follows:
